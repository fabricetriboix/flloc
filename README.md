flloc: A dynamic memory debugger
================================


Introduction
------------

flloc is dual-licensed under the GPLv3 and a commercial license. If you
require the commercial license, please contact me: "Fabrice Triboix"
<ftriboix-at-gmail-dot-com>.

This project has been created because I couldn't find a simple,
thread-aware memory debugger that would minimise its impact on the
running of the software.


Getting started
---------------

Follow the steps:

    $ $EDITOR Makefile
    $ make
    $ make test      # Run the unit tests
    $ make install   # Install

No warranties
-------------

I wrote these pieces of code on my spare time in the hope that they will
be useful. I make no warranty at all on their suitability for use in
any type of software application.
